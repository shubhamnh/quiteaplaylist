                Hello fellow beings!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Shubham here, maker of this app!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I often found quite a few videos in my Youtube Playlists which are made private or deleted due to copyright issues. It often happens with videos with music which were copyright protected but not limited to these.</p>
            <br>
             <p>As I couldn't find an easy way to find the details of these videos, I made this app to make it easier to find what those missing gems in the playlist are.</p>
             <br>
             <p>Hope this app helps you too!</p>

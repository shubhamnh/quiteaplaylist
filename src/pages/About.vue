            <p>Hello, fellow beings üëã</p>
            <br>
            <p>I often found videos in some of my YouTube playlists that are made private or get deleted. Many of these videos get taken down by YouTube on copyright grounds or if they have something controversial. Sometimes the uploader themselves decide to make it private or remove it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since YouTube doesn't give us anything about what the video was or about the uploader, it just left me wondering and guessing what these videos were. After a point, the number of videos that go missing from these playlists just left me annoyed. After all, we save something when we find it valuable and losing it is not a good feeling...</p>
            <br>
             <p>As I couldn't find an easy way to find the details of these videos, I made this site to make it easier to do so. It's mainly powered by the <a href="https://archive.org/" class="italic hover:underline" target="_blank" title="Internet Archive">Internet Archive</a>, which takes snapshots of web pages of all kinds! And for the gems that it can't find, we can easily search for them through other mediums in the hope that someone has posted it somewhere on the Internet!</p>
             <br>
             <p>Hope you find this site helpful!</p>
             <br>
             <p>Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è,<br>Shubham</p>
